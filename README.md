# RAII: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization

This repository provides a concise introduction to the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) concept in object-oriented programming, with an emphasis on C++. RAII is a key principle in C++ that helps manage resources such as memory, file handles, and network connections, ensuring they are properly acquired and released.

## What is RAII?

RAII is a programming idiom that binds the lifecycle of resources to the lifetime of objects. When an object is created, it acquires certain resources (like memory or file descriptors), and when the object is destroyed, those resources are released automatically. This approach greatly simplifies resource management and reduces errors like leaks or dangling pointers.
